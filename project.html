     <h2>Abstract:</h2>
      <p>The main theme of my web page is to bring to life an interactive open street map website that will share information to New Yorkers about the locations of affordable farmers market, food pantry's, local organic markets, or community gardens that have healthy vegetables and fruits at an affordable or free rate to New Yorkers within the 5 boroughs. It is important that healthy organic fruits and vegetables are accessible to all New Yorkers regardless of income, class, race, gender, etc,..It is important for New Yorkers to access these information so they know that there are affordable  farmers/local markets, and gardens surrounding their neighborhood, and that regardless of income, everyone deserves access to affordable organic fruits and vegetables.</p>

      <h2>Project Content & Description:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>One of the main demographic of the obesity health crisis in the United States of America is working class, poor, low income families. Studies have shown that low-income communities are likely to face childhood obesity especially among black and hispanic children in the U.S. The limitation of accessibility to healthy fruits and vegetables derives from poverty. There is a stigma that poor people are uneducated so they don’t know healthy alternatives, but that is false. They’re not ignorant. Most low income families just don’t have the luxury to access these organic healthy foods because 1) They’re expensive and 2) There is no accessibility and a lack of information to allocate these resources. It is more cheaper and accessible to buy fast food or junk food because they’re everywhere and it’s way cheaper. When there is accessibility to organic produce, it’s almost very expensive especially in stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe. When feeding a whole family of four, shopping at a place like whole foods for organic produce can easily cost $50-100. Most of the time, these stores are in gentrified neighborhoods or a middle- upper class area in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Within recent years, there have been an influx of communities that have come together to bring affordable farmers markets and local produce pantries to working class families that are free or do not cost a leg and an arm. In fact, some of these produce are grown locally, organically by the communities or non-profit organizations. There is still a barrier in getting information out to low income communities and letting them know that these options are accessible and are there for them. This website will help bring that information all New Yorkers by sharing affordable/free options for fruits and vegetables within their zip code or borough. It will also be designed in a simple and clean layout so it’s easy to maneuver. </p>
<br>
<p>Due to Covid-19, there have been many people who are laid off, and families that are struggling and are almost out of food supply. The information off where to produce free or even affordable produce will help them in a tremendous way. This project is to bring all New Yorkers together, providing accessibility to free/affordable organic produce to everyone, while also sharing information of different healthy options. Everybody should have access to healthy organic food regardless of income status and background. The place you come from or the money you have should never limit a family resources to a basic human necessity.

     <h2> Project Approach</h2>
     <p>The website will be designed with bootstrap, javascript, and CSS elements. The theme of the layout will be from Bootstrap. The website will be interactive because New Yorkers will use the website to search within their local area and borough. The layout design will take a simple and modern approach. The color palette will include neutral tones, reflective of organic and natural. When the website loads, the viewer will see the title of the website on the upper left side and a navigation bar on the right side. The middle of the page will include an image or slide show of markets or fruits/veggies. This includes graphic illustrations designed by me, or photos that will be taken by me (unsure yet due to covid restriction, but possibly be taken by the markets themselves with reference cited). There will also be text informing them to navigate the search bar to read the website’s about page and message. The main content is the navigation to the interactive map of NYC using OpenStreetMap. </P>
      <br>
      <p>The viewer will enter their zip code or borough, which will load all the free/affordable market produce near them. There will also be links to these markets website if applicable. The viewer can access these markets website to find more information of the type of produce they offered, hours, location, and other valuable resources.  Another content on the page will be an information section that will include the different types of vegetables and fruits that are accessible, possible recipe they can make, and other information about going to a local farmer’s market for the first time. This information will also include which markets are open at certain days and time, and markets that are accessible within each season. This information section will provide ease and comfort to those navigating these markets for the first time. Aside from icons, photos, and illustration, the website will possibly include videos and audio. These videos will be in the information section and possibly show the markets itself or information guide about the markets/garden in NYC.<p>
